## ‚ú® Overview

LinkSync is a revolutionary web-based tool that automates the entire process of designing and documenting Cisco network infrastructures. By simply providing your organizational requirements‚Äîsuch as the number of floors, departments, and desired services‚ÄîLinkSync's AI engine generates a complete, enterprise-grade network plan.

This isn't just a diagramming tool. LinkSync provides a full suite of documentation, including an interactive topology map, a detailed IP addressing plan, a complete cabling guide, and most importantly, **ready-to-use, copy-and-paste CLI configurations for every single device in the network.**

## üöÄ Key Features

* **AI-Powered Design:** Leverages the Gemini API to intelligently assist in the network design and modification process.
* **Multiple Design Tiers:** Choose from three pre-built templates to match your project's scale:
    * **SOHO:** A simple, flat network for small businesses or home labs.
    * **Standard Business:** A robust design with VLANs and inter-VLAN routing.
    * **Enterprise Grade:** A high-availability architecture with full redundancy and advanced security.
* **Interactive Topology Diagram:**
    * **Draggable Nodes:** Click and drag any device to rearrange the topology map.
    * **Informational Tooltips:** Hover over devices to see their model numbers.
* **Complete Configuration Generation:** Get full, copy-pastable CLI scripts for every device, including security best practices like `enable secret` and `service password-encryption`.
* **Detailed Documentation:** Automatically generates:
    * **Network IP Plan:** A clear table of all VLANs, subnets, gateways, and DHCP ranges.
    * **Cabling Guide:** A precise list of every connection and the required cable type.
* **Dynamic Cost Estimation:** Receive a realistic project budget based on the specific hardware in your generated design.
* **AI Chatbot for Reconfiguration:** Modify your design on the fly using natural language. Simply tell the AI assistant what to change, and it will instantly regenerate the entire project.
* **Immersive "Hacker" Theme:** A fully responsive, dark-mode UI with a "digital rain" background and glowing green accents for a unique user experience.
